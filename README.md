# Willard Networks: Staff ðŸ”ž
This repository serves as the clearest example not only of human vices such as hypocrisy and arrogance, but also of ignorance. It presents the true story of the discord server, which is the de facto main communication server of the Willard Networks staff team. History from January through August - the entire time the chatroom has existed is affected and presented to the public.

You can download files representing logs of four different channels (with a telling name) and open them in your browser. This may take a while to download, but it will give you an accurate picture of the true moral character of a member of the Willard Networks team.

You can also take a look at the individual quotes we selected when we first looked at all of these logs. First of all you would notice the hypocrisy, the real worries about the recent data leak [[1]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/they-can-find-out.png) [[2]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/be-concerned.png) [[3]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/just-in-case-1.png) [[4]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/just-in-case-2.png) [[5]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/makes-sense-for-you-to-be-hella-worried.png) [[6]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/they-(atle)-are-trying-to-downplay-what-has-happened.png), the advice to change passwords and emails (while their own players were assured by them that it was completely harmless) [[7]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/be-sure-to-change-your-email-and-password.png). You finish this with a sense of genuine disgust at the incredible sexual perversion [[8]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/pervert.png) [[9]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/do-what-with-member.png) [[10]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/erm-what.png) of the team members and their discussions about other admins "grooming" other community members [[11]](https://github.com/lifestorm/wnstaff/blob/main/quotes/reece-groomed-rislov.png).
